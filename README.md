## Next.js App Router Course - Starter

This is a guide that Bj√∂rk made in module 5, I followed the Next.js app router course (https://nextjs.org/learn) and made a few small changes.
- Added a registation function so you can register as a new user
- Added the customer table in the "Customer page"
- Added a "Settings page" where the logged in user is supposed to be able to change some user settings (not completed)
- On the "Settings page" you can change the user image url to change the profile image

the login you can use is:
username: user@nextmail.com
password: 123456

or you can just register as a new user.



This is the starter template for the Next.js App Router Course. It contains the starting code for the dashboard application.

For more information, see the [course curriculum](https://nextjs.org/learn) on the Next.js Website.
